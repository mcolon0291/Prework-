                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Marleni Colon. I am a 31 year old mother to a 2 year old
                    babyboy. I have a bachelors degree in Social Work. I have been in the
                    social work field for 6 plus years. Although it started me with my
                    career, I quickly found out I was not passionate about it and started my
                    own jewelry company. This was where I discovered my creativity for
                    developing my own website. I got intrigued with coding.
                </p><br />
                <p> I am outgoing, dedicated, and open-minded. I get across to people and
                  adjust to change with ease. I believe that a person should work on their
                  professional skills and learning new things all the time. I look forward
                  to learning more each and everyday. I feel this new journey will
                  teach me many things. </p>
